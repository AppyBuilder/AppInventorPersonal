This standalone version has been updated to run locally, on following platforms:
* Windows   
* Linux
* Mac

## Required Software / setup:
	Java JDK 1.8
	JAVA_HOME setup properly

## Starting servers:
* WinStartBuildServer   - starts the backend build servers
* WinStartFrontend.cmd  - starts the frontend UI
  - Once Frontend is started, start browser (Chrome or Firefox) and point your browser to: http://localhost:8888
	
## Troubleshooting:
   If you receive error "Address already in use", it means App Inventor was not shut-down
      gracefully. You'll need to kill java using task manager
