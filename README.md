# Welcome to AppInventor offline


## Description:
This is an Offline version of App Inventor that was created by AppyBuilder. 
App Inventor source code can be found at Github here: 
> https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources

This standalone version has been updated to run locally, on following platforms:
* Windows   
* Linux
* Mac

## Required Software / setup:
* Java JDK 1.8
  - You may need to install OpenJDK 8 if using Linux
* Setup JAVA_HOME properly

## Starting servers:
* WinStartBuildServer.bat   - starts the backend build servers
* WinStartFrontend.bat  - starts the frontend UI
  - Once Frontend is started, start browser (Chrome or Firefox) and point your browser to: http://localhost:8888
* If using Linux or Mac, use the startBuildServer.sh and startFromend.sh

## Troubleshooting:
   If you receive error "Address already in use", it means App Inventor was not shut-down
      gracefully. You'll need to kill java using task manager
